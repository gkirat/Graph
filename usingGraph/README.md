## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gkirat/Graph.git
2. Go to usingGraph folder:

   ```bash
   cd usingGraph
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
4. Run the development server:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Code Overview

- App.js: This is the main application component.
- Prerequisites: Make sure to have an Ethereum wallet or Metamask extension installed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## How It Works
1. The app connects to The Graph by providing the URL to the Graph API endpoint.
2. Click the "Click for info" button to trigger the data retrieval process.
3. The app times how long it takes to retrieve data from the Ethereum blockchain using The Graph is shown in console in milliseconds.
4. The retrieved data, including Ethereum addresses and numerical values, is displayed on the screen.
