# Data Retrieval with Ethereum using ethers.js

This project demonstrates how to retrieve data from the Ethereum blockchain using ethers.js, a library for interacting with Ethereum. In this method, we directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain to fetch data. This README provides an overview of the code and how it works.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gkirat/Graph.git
2. Go to Graph directory:

   ```bash
   cd Graph
3. Go to usingNormalBlockchain directory:

   ```bash
   cd usingNormalBlockchain
4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
5. Run the development server:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   
## Code Overview

- App.js: This is the main application component.
- Prerequisites: Make sure to have an Ethereum wallet or Metamask extension installed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## How It Works

1. The app connects to the Ethereum blockchain using ethers.js and Metamask.
2. Click the "Click to connect" button to connect your Ethereum wallet to the app.
3. After connecting your wallet, click the "Click for info" button to trigger the data retrieval process.
4. The app times how long it takes to retrieve data from the Ethereum blockchain.
5. The retrieved data, including Ethereum addresses and numerical values, is displayed on the CONSOLE.
